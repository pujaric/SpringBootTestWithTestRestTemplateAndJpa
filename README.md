## 🔍 MockMvc vs TestRestTemplate in Spring Boot Tests

```
| Feature              | `MockMvc`                               | `TestRestTemplate`                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Starts Web Server    | ❌ No                                   | ✅ Yes (embedded Tomcat/Jetty/etc.)  |
| Speed                | ⚡ Faster                                | 🐢 Slower (due to full HTTP stack)   |
| Full-stack Testing   | ❌ No (bypasses filters, servlet layer) | ✅ Yes (real servlet context)        |
| Real HTTP Layer      | ❌ No                                   | ✅ Yes                               |
| Test Complexity      | ✅ Easier for unit-style                | 🧪 Closer to real-world behavior     |

### ✅ When to Use What?

- **Use `MockMvc`** when:
  - You want fast, lightweight controller tests.
  - You don't need actual network/servlet layer.

- **Use `TestRestTemplate`** when:
  - You need full-stack integration testing.
  - You want to test filters, security, headers, cookies, etc.
  - You simulate real HTTP client behavior.

> 💡 Both are useful depending on your testing goal. It's common to use `MockMvc` for controller-level unit tests and `TestRestTemplate` for integration tests.
